# /db

This folder only includes our MySQL database export file/s. 

Only include:
- `helpinghand.sql` --> This is the main database file. Only manipulate this as much as possible
- Optional backup `.sql` database files. (name them clearly, according to date preferably, like `helpinghand_07-01.sql`)
- Optional `.txt` files for instructions if needed.

Files to Avoid:
- `.sqlite`, `.db`, or any raw XAMPP files
- Do NOT commit any of your personal database folders. 

Note:
- Make sure you export your database **with data + structure** from phpMyAdmin.
- If you update this file, notify the group right away.
