# /pages

These contain the actual website pages that the users/admins see.

Each file here could be a mix of HTML and PHP, such as:
- `login.php`
- `user_dashboard.php`
- `admin_dashboard.php`
- `help_board.php`

Please label your files clearly, and use consistent structure so nobody gets confused.
