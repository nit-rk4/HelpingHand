# /css

Place all the styles you will use throughout the website HERE. Let's use one main stylesheet for now `style.css` for simplicity.

Please organize `style.css` into sections so there won't be any confusion between the frontend developers.

Also use consistent prefixes when naming your classes to avoid any name conflicts:
- `um-` = User Menu
- `am-` = Admin Menu
- `hb-` = Help Board

Example:
`um-button` refers to buttons used in the user menu, and `am-button` refers to buttons used in the admin menu.
